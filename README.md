There is an issue with Github pages deployment at the moment not loading the svg file.  Recommend to download entire repo and run for now.

For an example here is a github pages deployment, however, there is no terrain (svg not loading) and cannot move or transform robot which are all things you can do in the actual game.  So please only use for reference to what this game would look like.
